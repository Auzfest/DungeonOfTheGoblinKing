# Overview

This is a fun project used to improve my organization within code that interconnects in different ways

A Choose Your Own Adventure game wher the user is the hero of the story going into a dungeon to defeat the Goblin King! Will you be able to navigate and make the right choices to complete this hero's quest?


The purpose of creating this was to make a simple text game for fun. It also was made to help with my organization of code.
